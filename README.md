## Main steps:

The main tasks we have to overcome are.
Read an image of possibly handwritten text and convert it into type we can use.
We then have to summarise the information into key data
Then using this summary we must find matching youtube videos which help further the understanding of a topic.
Then we have to present this data to the user in a meaningful way
